# DeepLearning-Diving-Deeperüåäüîç
## Introduction
Welcome to **DeepLearning-Diving-Deeper**‚Äîa repository where I document my journey into the world of deep learning. With previous experience in AI and deep learning projects, I'm using this summer to deepen my knowledge while preparing for my IELTS exam. This repo captures my progress, experiments, and key learnings as I explore advanced concepts and techniques.

## What's Inside
- **Projects**: Implementations of deep learning models, from basic neural networks to advanced architectures like CNNs, RNNs, and transformers.
- **Research Explorations**: Replications and discussions of notable research papers, aimed at understanding and extending key ideas.
- **Experiments**: Exploratory work testing new ideas, fine-tuning models, and applying deep learning to novel problems.
- **Learning Notes**: Summaries and reflections on important deep learning concepts, techniques, and research findings.

## Featured Work
- **CNN Projects**: Image classification, object detection, and transfer learning using pre-trained models.
- **RNN & LSTM Projects**: Language modeling, text generation, and time-series forecasting.
- **Transformer Models**: Implementations of BERT, GPT, and other NLP models.
- **Generative Models**: Experiments with GANs and VAEs for creative data generation.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: RL algorithms applied to control problems and simulations.

## My Learning Path
1. **Foundations**: Revisiting deep learning basics to ensure a strong grasp of the fundamentals.
2. **Advanced Models**: Diving into complex architectures and experimenting with real-world applications.
3. **Continuous Exploration**: Engaging with the latest research and trying out new ideas in deep learning.
